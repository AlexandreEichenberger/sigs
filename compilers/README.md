# ONNX Compiler Special Interest Group (SIG)

This is the working repo for the Compiler Special Interest Group (SIG), which is responsible for compiler solutions that optimizes and lower ONNX core format file to representations that are fed to further compilers, runtimes, or directly executed.
The compiler solutions investigated by this SIG consumes ONNX core files defined by the Architecture & Infrastrucutre SIG and uses ONNX operations defined by the Operator SIG.
This SIG is open to solutions developped any relevant compiler infrastructures.
Projects sponsored by this SIG may work in specific, open-sourced, compiler infrastructures.

This repo contains all the artifacts, materials, meeting notes and proposals regarding the Compiler SIG.

Feedbacks and contributions are welcome.
