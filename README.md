# SIGs

As described in the [ONNX governance](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/tree/master/community), SIGs are persistent groups that are responsible for specific parts of the project.

The SIGs can use this repository to store artifacts. The SIG chairs have merge permissions on the repo but should only handle PRs related to their group.
