## Agenda
* Introduction
* Logistics
* SIG Goals
* Discussion topics
    * What is the role of ONNXMLTools? If it should be a wrapper of the other converters, then TF support needs to be added. If not, should it be renamed?
    * Establish quality bar for converters under ONNX, including error messages, documentation and other usability aspects.
    * Converters are best handled within the source framework itself if possible – SIG should define strategy to graduate the various converters
    * Triaging of all convertor issues across the repos.
    * Standard tests and validation for backend, frontend, and potentially training
    * Centralized reporting for all converters (status, coverage, versions, etc.)
    * Converter pain points … what is not working
    * Things users are looking for in the future
